# inline-styles-super-simple-boilerplate
This package was inspired by Nicole Sullivan's comment on [Shop Talk #180](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/180-panel-on-inline-styles/) when she said mentioned that there is currently not a quick and easy way to get started with inline styles, and that this makes getting started prohibitive to the unfamiliar.

Core tech:
* React
* Radium
* Webpack

If you're unfamiliar with React, there is a [fantastic guide](http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/) to help get you started so this repo doesn't look like Klingon. If you're already into inline styles, check out my [resource list](https://github.com/yejodido/Inline-Styles-Resource), I think you'll find a lot of cool stuff inside.

Poke around, have fun. I hope you find it useful.

##Up and running in 4 commands:

```
#clone the repo and cd into it
$ git clone https://github.com/yejodido/inline-styles-super-simple-boilerplate.git

#install dependencies
$ npm install

#create your distribution
$ webpack

#start playing
$ npm start
```

Navigate to ```localhost:8080```in your browser and you're golden.
